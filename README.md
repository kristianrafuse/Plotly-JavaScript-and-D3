Plotly, JavaScript, and D3

In this example, I use JavaScript to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogues the microbes that colonize human navels. Specifically, I construct various JavaScript functions and event listeners to update Plotly charts based on user interactions in order to explore the dataset.
