Plotly, JavaScript, and D3
-------
In this example, I use JavaScript to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (json) which catalogues the microbes that colonize human navels. Specifically, I construct various JavaScript functions and event listeners to update Plotly charts based on user interactions in order to explore the dataset.

* Implement basic JavaScript control flow (functions, loops, if/else statements).
* Create functions in JavaScript.
* Create, update, and iterate JavaScript objects.
* Create basic charts, including bar charts and line charts, by using Plotly.
* Use Plotly's layout object to customize the appearance of charts.
* Annotate charts with labels, text, and hover text.
* Apply the map() method and filter to parse data.
* Create and use arrow functions to simplify code.
* Use the filter() and arrow functions to manipulate and filter datasets.
* Use ES6 JavaScript methods.
* Create charts by using data from API calls.
* Use D3 for basic document object model (DOM) manipulation and event handling.
* Dynamically manipulate the DOM through events.
* Manipulate charts through dropdown events and click events.
